## Results: 
### 1 - Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

To discover if Google search traffic for the company links to any financial events at the company. Or, does the search traffic data just present random noise? To answer this question, pick out any unusual patterns in the Google search data for the company, and connect them to the corporate financial events.

- Read the search data into a DataFrame, and then slice the data to just the month of May 2020. During this month, MercadoLibre released its quarterly financial results.
    ```
    df_mercado_trends = pd.read_csv("google_hourly_search_trends.csv",
                                    index_col = "Date",
                                    parse_dates = True,
                                    infer_datetime_format = True)

    ```
- Use hvPlot to visualize the results. Detect if there is any unusual patterns exist.
    ![df_may_2020_hvplot](Resources/df_may_2020_hvplot.png)

- Calculate the total search traffic for the month(May 2020), and then compare the value to the monthly median across all months. 

    traffic_may_2020/median_monthly_traffic = 1.085536

- Insights: 
    > Did the Google search traffic increase during the month that MercadoLibre released its financial results?

        1. Some unusual spikes are shown in the graph. At the beginning of May (around 5/5 and 5/6), The company got more searches. This the time when MercadoLibre released its quarterly financial results. It suggests that the higher traffic days in this month were generated by increased investor interest.
        2. The total search traffic for 2020-05 was also 8.5% higher than the overall median monthly traffic for the company.


### 2 - Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

Search data is potentially helpful for Marketing team, too. If they can track and predict interest in the company and its platform for any time of day, they can focus their marketing efforts around the times that have the most traffic. This will get a greater return on investment (ROI) from their marketing budget.

- Group the hourly search data to plot the average traffic by the day of the week.
    ```
    weekly_traffic = df_mercado_trends.groupby(df_mercado_trends.index.dayofweek).mean()
    ```
    ![weekly_traffic](Resources/weekly_traffic.png)
    ![weekly_traffic_hvplot](Resources/weekly_traffic_hvplot.png)

- Using hvPlot, visualize this traffic as a heatmap, referencing the `index.hour` as the x-axis and the `index.dayofweek` as the y-axis. 
    ```
    df_mercado_trends.hvplot.heatmap(x='index.hour', y='index.dayofweek', C='Search Trends', reduce_function=np.mean, cmap='reds', colorbar=True)
    ```
    ![df_mercado_trends_heatmap](Resources/df_mercado_trends_heatmap.png)

- Group the search data by the week of the year. 
    ```
    yearly_traffic = df_mercado_trends.groupby(df_mercado_trends.index.week).mean()
    ```
    ![yearly_traffic_hvplot](Resources/yearly_traffic_hvplot.png)

- Insights:
    >   Does any day-of-week effect that you observe concentrate in just a few hours of that day?

        1. Most traffic are on Monday through Thursday. Friday and Saturday's seache traffics slows down. 
        2. Overall, people are less interested in searching in the morning, which shown by the cooler region. Searches increase in the afternoon and evenings, especially late evenings.
        3. Compare to weekdays, searches on weekend is shifted by one or two hours earlier. People may go for early online shopping.

    >   Does the search traffic tend to increase during the winter holiday period (weeks 40 through 52)?

        1. During the winter holiday (weeks 40 through 52), search traffic tends to increase since week 41 (mid-October). People started holiday shopping to prepare for Christmas and New Year. 
        2. However, week 51 reaches to the peak of the pattern. The following week 52 is the end of year. People unlikely shopping during this time, may enjoying their holiday with families and friends.
        3. The search gets back to normal or get even higher at the begining of the year. This may caused by increased shopping for new year or lured by big discount for holiday clearance.  


### 3 - Relate the Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns

Discover if any relationship between the search data and the company stock price exists for finance group. 

To do so, complete the following steps:

- Read in and plot the stock price data. Concatenate the stock price data to the search data in a single DataFrame.
    ```
    df_mercado_stock = pd.read_csv("mercado_stock_price.csv",index_col="date",parse_dates=True,infer_datetime_format=True)
    ```
    ```
    mercado_stock_trends_df = pd.concat([df_mercado_stock,df_mercado_trends], axis=1).dropna()
    ```

    ![mercado_stock_trends_df](Resources/mercado_stock_trends_df.png)
    ![df_mercado_stock_hvplot](Resources/df_mercado_stock_hvplot.png)

- Market events emerged during the year of 2020 that many companies found difficult. But, after the initial shock to global financial markets, new customers and revenue increased for e-commerce platforms. Slice the data to just the first half of 2020 (`2020-01` to `2020-06` in the DataFrame), and then use hvPlot to plot the data. 
    ![first_half_2020_search_hvplot](Resources/first_half_2020_search_hvplot.png)
    ![first_half_2020_stock_hvplot](Resources/first_half_2020_stock_hvplot.png)


- Insights:
    > Do both time series indicate a common trend that’s consistent with this narrative?
     
        1. In fact, the evidence of a common trend between search activity and stock price is pretty limited. However, for the lowest points of stock price, which appears in late March through early April, did coincide with the lower search activities.
        2. Searches turned more activate later, brought up the stock price since late April. The stock price keep onwarding, the search activities remained stable.
        3. There is spike on search pattern in May-05-2020, almost at the same time, stock price had a steep slope growth. This time aligned with the date of company's quarterly report release to the public. The peak of searching was a couple of hours later than the stock price spike. This might indicate that the Google search pattern can predict the stock price. An alternative explanation might be that people just search for more information about the company before its earnings release announcement. For this hypothesis, we need to do more time series analysis to see which explanation best fits the data.

-  Create a new column in the DataFrame named “Lagged Search Trends” that offsets, or shifts, the search traffic by one hour. Create two additional columns:

    
    **Hourly Stock Return** holds the percent change of the company's stock price on an hourly basis
    **Stock Volatility** holds an exponentially weighted four-hour rolling average of the company’s stock volatility

    ```
    mercado_stock_trends_df['Lagged Search Trends'] = mercado_stock_trends_df['Search Trends'].shift(1)
    mercado_stock_trends_df['Hourly Stock Return'] = mercado_stock_trends_df['close'].pct_change()
    mercado_stock_trends_df['Stock Volatility'] = mercado_stock_trends_df['close'].pct_change().rolling(window=4).std()
    ```
    ![mercado_stock_trends_df_plus](Resources/mercado_stock_trends_df_plus.png)

- Review the time series correlation to discover the relationship between variables.
    ![mercado_stock_trends_df_corr](Resources/mercado_stock_trends_df_corr.png)

- Insights:
    > Does a predictable relationship exist between the lagged search traffic and the stock volatility or between the lagged search traffic and the stock price returns?

        1. There is a slightly negative correlation between searches for the company and its subsequent stock volatility (-0.148938). More searches tend to indicate less near-term hourly stock risk for the company.
        2. There is positive correlation between search activity in an hour and stock returns in the next. As search activity goes up, stock return goes up in the next hour. But this correlation(0.017929) is very weak though. It might be chances that it is random. Search trends is hard to predict the market.

### 4 - Create a Time Series Model with Prophet

Produce a time series model that analyzes and forecasts patterns in the hourly search data. 

- Set up the Google search data for a Prophet forecasting model.
    ```
    mercado_prophet_df = df_mercado_trends.reset_index()
    mercado_prophet_df.columns=['ds','y']
    mercado_prophet_df = mercado_prophet_df.dropna()
    ```

- Create Prophet model, plot the forecast. 
    ```
    model_mercado_trends = Prophet()
    model_mercado_trends.fit(mercado_prophet_df)
    future_mercado_trends = model_mercado_trends.make_future_dataframe(periods=2000, freq='H') 
    forecast_mercado_trends = model_mercado_trends.predict(future_mercado_trends)
    ```
    ![model_mercado_trends](Resources/model_mercado_trends.png)


- Plot the individual time series components of the model to reveal the patterns.
    ```
    forecast_mercado_trends[['yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper']].iloc[-2000:,:].hvplot()
    model_mercado_trends.plot_components(forecast_mercado_trends)
    ```
    ![forecast_mercado_trends](Resources/forecast_mercado_trends.png)
    ![figures_mercado_trends](Resources/figures_mercado_trends_ds.png)

        In the middle of October, the last week of the year and the first week of the year , search traffic get the lowest periods. The October low could be a holiday effect.


### 5 - Forecast Revenue by Using Time Series Models

With sales data, it is possible to make a forecast of the total sales for the next quarter for the finance team need. This will dramatically increase their ability to plan budgets and to help guide expectations for the company investors.


- Read in the daily historical sales (that is, revenue) figures, and then apply a Prophet model to the data.
    ```
    df_mercado_sales = pd.read_csv("mercado_daily_revenue.csv",index_col='date',parse_dates=True,infer_datetime_format=True)
    ```
    ![df_mercado_sales_hvplot](Resources/df_mercado_sales_hvplot.png)
    ![mercado_sales_prophet_model_plot](Resources/mercado_sales_prophet_model_plot.png)

- Interpret the model output to identify any seasonal patterns in the company's revenue. For example, what are the peak revenue days? (Mondays? Fridays? Something else?)
    ![mercado_sales_prophet_model](Resources/mercado_sales_prophet_model.png)

- Produce a sales forecast for the finance group. 
    ![mercado_sales_forecast_quarter](Resources/mercado_sales_forecast_quarter.png)
    ![mercado_sales_forecast_quarter_sum](Resources/mercado_sales_forecast_quarter_sum.png)

- Insights:
    > How much will be the expected total sales in the next quarter? What's the suggestion for finance team to help them make better plans? 
        
        The total sales next quarter is expected between  $888−1052 Million. Most likely to be $970 Million. That means if the finance team doesn't want to raise debt next quarter, they can make sure expenditures next quarter don't outpace the amount of revenue anticipated under the worst case 888 million USD. This would ensure that revenue received is sufficient to cover costs, without having to seek outside financing.
        
### Summary
